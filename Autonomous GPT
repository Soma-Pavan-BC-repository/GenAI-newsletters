uto-GPT uses the versatility of OpenAI’s latest AI models to interact with software and services online, allowing it to “autonomously” perform tasks 
like X and Y. But as we are learning with large language models, this capability seems to be as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle.

Auto-GPT — which you might’ve seen blowing up on social media recently — is an open source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that 
uses OpenAI’s text-generating models, mainly GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to act “autonomously.”


There’s no magic in that autonomy. Auto-GPT simply handles follow-ups to an initial prompt of OpenAI’s models, both asking and answering them until 
a task is complete.

Auto-GPT, basically, is GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 paired with a companion bot that instructs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 what to do. A user tells Auto-GPT what their 
goal is and the bot, in turn, uses GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and several programs to carry out every step needed to achieve whatever goal they’ve set.

What makes Auto-GPT reasonably capable is its ability to interact with apps, software and services both online and local, like web browsers and 
word processors. For example, given a prompt like “help me grow my flower business,” Auto-GPT can develop a somewhat plausible advertising strategy 
and build a basic website.

Behind the scenes, Auto-GPT relies on features like memory management to execute tasks, along with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for text generation, file storage and summarization.

Auto-GPT can also be hooked up to speech synthesizers, like ElevenLabs’, so that it can “place” phone calls, for example.


Auto-GPT is publicly available on GitHub, but it does require some setup and know-how to get up and running. To use it, Auto-GPT has to be installed 
in a development environment like Docker, and it must be registered with an API key from OpenAI — which requires a paid OpenAI account.

It might be worth it — although the jury’s out on that. Early adopters have used Auto-GPT to take on the sorts of mundane tasks better delegated 
to a bot. For example, Auto-GPT can field items like debugging code and writing an email or more advanced things, like creating a business plan 
for a new startup.

“If Auto-GPT encounters any obstacles or inability to finish the task, it’ll develop new prompts to help it navigate the situation and determine 
the appropriate next steps,” Adnan Masood, the chief architect at UST, a tech consultancy firm, told TechCrunch in an email. 
“Large language models excel at generating human-like responses, yet rely on user prompts and interactions to deliver desired outcomes. 
In contrast, Auto-GPT leverages the advanced capabilities of OpenAI’s API to operate independently without user intervention.”

In recent weeks, new apps have emerged to make Auto-GPT even easier to use, like AgentGPT and GodMode, which provide a simple interface where users 
can input what they want to accomplish directly on a browser page. Note that, like Agent-GPT, both require an API key from OpenAI to unlock their 
full capabilities.
